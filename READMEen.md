## 1. Preamble

Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, Linkedin, etc. Social networks have invaded our lives. We either love or hate them, and many of us cannot live without them.

There are social networks of all kinds and for all kinds of interests. For example, in an investor financing round, a social network for chemists was launched where users could post articles about their research, comment on their colleagues' articles, and filter articles according to certain tags or popularity. the most recent, or most commented.

## 2. Product definition


Linkedin is a social network for professional use, it was founded in 2002, according to an [article](https://kinsta.com/es/blog/estadisticas-de-linkedin/) published this year, it has more than 575 million users, with more than 260 million active users. It has multiple functionalities that help to expose the academic level, work experience, apply for job offers and expand your network of contacts. However, a survey was conducted for this project that yielded some opportunities for improvement

My proposal for this social network is to segment the demand and professional offer, this would facilitate the search for offers and hire services directly as fiverr does in the case of independent
